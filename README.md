# This classic Snake Game is built using Python and Pygame, a popular game development library. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. The objective is to achieve the highest possible score by eating as much food as possible without crashing.

To run the Snake Game, follow these steps:

•Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your local machine. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/).

•Install Pygame: Pygame is required to run the Snake Game. You can install Pygame using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt: pip install pygame.

•Clone or download the game: You can clone the Snake Game repository from GitHub (https://github.com/yourusername/snake-game) or download the ZIP file and extract it to your local machine.
